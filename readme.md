Data release to accompany 2019 research report [Freedom of Information in Local Government](https://research.mysociety.org/publications/freedom-information-local-government).

These CSVs contain the collective information obtained via FOI (on [WhatDoTheyKnow.com](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com)) on FOI statistics and administration of local authorities in the UK. 

Each entry has a link to the relevant FOI - where examining individual examples it's best to refer back to the original FOI in case of transcription errors.
